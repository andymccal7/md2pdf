# md2pdf & pdf2md

Convert between Markdown and PDF. Includes `md2pdf` for themed PDF generation and `pdf2md` for PDF-to-Markdown extraction (with OCR fallback and optional AI cleanup).

## Installation

### Requirements

- **Node.js** (v14 or later) - [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (for md2pdf)
- **Python 3** with `pymupdf4llm` (for pdf2md)
- **pdfinfo** (optional, for page count) - usually bundled with poppler

**Optional (for image-based PDFs):**
- **tesseract** - OCR engine: `brew install tesseract`
- **pytesseract** and **Pillow** - Python bindings: `pip3 install pytesseract Pillow`
- **anthropic** - AI cleanup of OCR output: `pip3 install anthropic`

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FellowTraveler/md2pdf.git
cd md2pdf
./install.sh
```

This installs:
- `md2pdf` and `pdf2md` scripts to `~/bin/`
- Theme CSS files to `~/.md2pdf-themes/`
- Finder Quick Actions to `~/Library/Services/` (right-click context menu)

If `~/bin` is not in your PATH, the installer will show you how to add it.

**Important:** After pulling updates or making changes to the scripts, you must re-run `./install.sh` to copy the updated scripts to `~/bin/` and refresh the Quick Actions.

## Usage

```
md2pdf - Convert Markdown to beautiful PDFs

USAGE:
    md2pdf <file.md> [theme]     Convert markdown to PDF
    md2pdf --list                List available themes
    md2pdf --help                Show this help

OUTPUT:
    Creates a PDF file with the same name as the input file.
    Example: README.md -> README.pdf

THEMES:
    academic
    claude
    dark
    executive
    github
    minimal
    modern

EXAMPLES:
    md2pdf README.md             # -> README.pdf (default: executive)
    md2pdf README.md minimal     # -> README.pdf (minimal theme)
    md2pdf docs/guide.md modern  # -> docs/guide.pdf (modern theme)
```

### Output

Creates a PDF with the same name as the input file:
- `README.md` → `README.pdf`
- `docs/guide.md` → `docs/guide.pdf`

### Examples

```bash
md2pdf README.md              # Uses default theme (executive)
md2pdf README.md minimal      # Uses minimal theme
md2pdf docs/guide.md modern   # Convert with modern theme
```

### Commands

```bash
md2pdf --list    # List available themes with descriptions
md2pdf --help    # Show help
```

## Themes

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **executive** | Professional corporate style with navy blue accents. Default. |
| **minimal** | Clean, sparse design with maximum whitespace. |
| **academic** | Traditional serif typography for papers and articles. |
| **modern** | Contemporary tech documentation style. |
| **github** | GitHub's markdown rendering style. |
| **dark** | Dark background with light text. |
| **claude** | Claude Desktop's warm, clean aesthetic. |

Run `md2pdf --list` for detailed theme descriptions.

## Custom Themes

Add your own CSS files to `~/.md2pdf-themes/` and they'll appear in the theme list.

## pdf2md

Convert PDF files to Markdown. Handles both text-based and image-based (scanned) PDFs.

```
pdf2md - Convert PDF files to Markdown

USAGE:
    pdf2md <file.pdf>     Convert PDF to Markdown
    pdf2md --help         Show this help

OUTPUT:
    Creates a Markdown file with the same name as the input file.
    Example: README.pdf -> README.md
```

### How It Works

1. **Text extraction** — Uses `pymupdf4llm` to extract text and formatting directly from the PDF.
2. **OCR fallback** — If no text is found (image-based/scanned PDFs), falls back to `tesseract` OCR.
3. **AI cleanup** (optional) — If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, sends OCR output to Claude Haiku to clean up duplicates, fix artifacts, and restore markdown formatting.

### Examples

```bash
pdf2md document.pdf              # -> document.md
pdf2md scanned-doc.pdf           # OCR + optional AI cleanup
```

### AI Cleanup for OCR

OCR output from scanned PDFs is often messy (duplicated content, garbled text, lost formatting). Setting `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` enables automatic cleanup via Claude Haiku.

**Option 1: Environment variable** (works from terminal)

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
pdf2md scanned-doc.pdf
```

**Option 2: Config file** (works everywhere, including Finder Quick Actions)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/pdf2md
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."' > ~/.config/pdf2md/env
```

Both methods work. The config file is recommended because it also works when pdf2md is invoked from Finder Quick Actions, which don't have access to your shell environment variables.

Without the API key, pdf2md still works — you just get the raw OCR output with a tip about enabling cleanup.

## Finder Quick Actions

The installer adds right-click context menu actions for macOS Finder:

- **Convert MD to PDF** — Right-click any `.md` file to convert it to PDF
- **Convert PDF to MD** — Right-click any `.pdf` file to convert it to Markdown

These appear under **Quick Actions** in the Finder right-click menu. A macOS notification confirms when the conversion is complete.
